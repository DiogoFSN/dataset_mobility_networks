# Sao Paulo metro 2017

The Sao Paulo metro 2017 data is available at [this link](https://www.metro.sp.gov.br/pesquisa-od/). It contains the numbers of trips from traffic zones in the metropolitan area of Sao Paulo, Brazil, distinguishing different transport modes, namely on foot, by car, by bicycle, using collective transport, individual and non-motorized transport. For each transport mode, there is a weighted adjacency matrix in a xlsx file. 

We provide the networks built from this file in GraphML format, including geographical coordinates and scripts to plot them according to the networks generated in GraphML.
